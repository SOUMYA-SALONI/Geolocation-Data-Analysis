# Geolocation-Data-Analysis
This project deals with locating the hotels and food services in a area to enable a individual to avail there preference food when desired.
Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this information.
In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a
frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course,
even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good
meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly
understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect
of the lifestyle one leads.
Now, imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already
have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food
providers a lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience
means better sales, and saved time for the customer.
